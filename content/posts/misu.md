Tried this restaurant because I was able to find vegan options in all sections.

I went with a friend and we tried vegan pho soup, vegan khow suey and vegan ramen. All of them were good. The khow suey is not vegan in their menu but we were able to get it made vegan on request. They also have vegan dimsums which we did not try.

This place also mentioned two vegan desserts in their zomato menu. But we found that they had only one available. I am not a fan of matcha in desserts. So did not opt for it.

The food was really good.   

Price range - Rs 1200 for two people
