Hatti Kaapi was a pleasant surprise. We went to this place to check out their vegan menu.

I liked the fact that they are looking to promote veganism as a lifestyle. More power to them.

We ordered the vegan cheese sandwich, brownie, cold Oreo frappe and masala peanut bun.

The vegan cheese sandwich was wonderful. Reminded me strongly of a good cheese sandwich. The vegan cheese had a distinct taste and it was quite close to milk cheese.

The cold Oreo frappe was good too. I had missed having a good milkshake since turning vegan and this one was came close to having one.

The masala peanut bun was quite tasty and filling too.

The brownie however was disappointing. It wasn't fudgy as a good brownie should be.

Definitely will come back to try the other vegan dishes in their menu.

Cost was in the range of RS 400 for 2 people.
