I like this place for their healthy tiffin options. All tiffin items are made with a combination of millets. The food is made home style. It is also hygienic.

Breakfast - Millet dosa (about 10 varieties), millet paddu, millet idli, millet chappathi   
Lunch - Sambhar millet + breakfast items   
Dinner - Millet dosa (about 10 varieties), millet paddu, millet idli, millet chapathi   

Price range - Rs 100 per person per meal
