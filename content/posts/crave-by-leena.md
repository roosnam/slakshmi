Best place for indulgent vegan desserts.

This place is run by Leena, a pastry chef who has turned into a vegan desserts chef since 2014. She runs this venture from her home.

She usually bakes to order but does have few items in the menu especially cupcakes available impromptu.

We surprised her today and came back with delicious pinacolada and chocolate cupcakes. Wouldn't find the difference between this one and a dairy based cupcake.

She also mentioned that she does high tea twice a month on Sundays. You can find the dates in her Instagram profile.

Definitely a must try place when you miss indulging in cakes and other bakes.

Price - Rs 450 for 6 cupcakes and cakes start from RS 1500 per kg.
